## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling. A key learning point was how to properly align elements using Flexbox, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes. Hereâ€™s a snippet of how I centered the QR code component:

.main-container{
      display: grid;
      justify-content: center;
      grid-template-rows: auto auto;
      row-gap: 45px;
    }


### Continued development
  Going forward, I want to:

  Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

  Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels.

  Learn SASS/SCSS to make styling more efficient.
